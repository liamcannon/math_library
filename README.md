# math_library

This is a small math library using a shared object library to add some functionality.
To start you'll need to open and compile with make
Then sudo make install to add it
Once installed open you're shell and type math_driver
There is a tldr man page that shows how to use the program 
ie... 
gcd

This would be the proper usage
